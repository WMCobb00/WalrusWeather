**Purpose:**  
My first JavaFX project completed in my CSII course at Bridgewater State University. The goal with this was to create
a simple GUI to allow a user to request and view live weather forecasts for major cities around the globe.

**Learned:**  
Through completing this project, I was able to gain a better understanding of the gradle framework, JavaFX, FXML files,
and JavaFX SceneBuilder. This was also my first time interacting with an API and parsing JSON responses and it served
as a great introduction to both.
